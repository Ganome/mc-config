This is a collection of the plugins I have assembled for Minecraft version 1.16.4 - This compilation is my current setup for a SMP (Survival MultiPlayer) server that i host for my kids.

I have added extra shops in the ShopsGUIPlus; including every staineed glass, concrete, terracotta, and even shulker shells, bottle rockets, lots of goodies in the shop!

I did not write ANY of these plugins!  I am only using them on my server.  All creative ownership goes to the respective owner of that plugin.

Plugins Include:

CoreProtect - For restoring griefed areas
EssentialsX - Essential plugin that handles chat prefix/suffix, warps, player teleports, among many others.
Jobs - Jobs plugin that allows a player to gain extra experience from joining a job with "/jobs join"
LuckPerms - WebGUI Permission manager
ShopGUIPlus - Type "/shop" to be greeted with a custom menu in game to purchase/sell blocks
Vault - Keeps track of player economy
ViaVersion - Allow multiple versions or older versions of Minecraft client to join this server.
mcMMO - Turns Minecraft into an MMO game. Where you are allowed to level skills such as farming, repair, swords, axes, acrobatics, even potion brewing!
